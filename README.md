# Kimble

This project aims to create a playable Kimble game that can be played either with other human players or against AI. The ultimate goal is to test different playing strategies with AI players by running numerous games and collecting data for strategy analysis.

This Kimble is played with AS-Kimble drinking rules which can be found (in Finnish) from [RULES](http://kimble.dy.fi/saannot).
